        2. Do Problem 6.24.
            Name your program Prob0624.pep. Hand in the .pep source file electronically per the instructions for
            your course.
        3. Do Problem 6.25.
            Name your program Prob0625.pep. Hand in the .pep source file electronically per the instructions for
            your course.

    [ ] - Assignment 22
        Do Problem 7.19(d).
            Restriction: 
                For all phases of this project you may not use any Java library functions that parse strings,
                for example Integer.parseInt(). That would defeat the purpose of the program, which is to parse the
                source.
            Additional restriction: 
                For this phase, you may not use any print statements like System.out.printf()
                in your generateCode() methods. All printing must be done in method translate(). The purpose of
                generateCode() is to return the string to be output. Use the formatting features of String.format()
                to compose the string to be returned by generateCode().
            Name your Java package prob0719. Note the lowercase p. Create a separate source file for each Java class.
            The first line of your source files must be package prob0719;. Name your IntelliJ project Prob0719
            and the class that has the main program as Prob0719Main in a file named Prob0719Main.java.
            Export the source files in a JAR file named Prob0719.jar. Hand in the .jar file.
